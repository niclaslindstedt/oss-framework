// Retry policy for the save path. Pure so the schedule can be unit-tested
// without a fake timer or a live adapter: your app's sync engine reads
// `MAX_TRANSIENT_SAVE_RETRIES`, `backoffDelayMs`, and `isRetryableSaveError`
// and owns the actual `setTimeout` / save-queue plumbing. The framework ships
// the policy (the numbers + the curve + the should-I-retry predicate); the
// engine that applies it stays in your app.
//
// Two callers, two shapes:
//
// 1. Transient save failures — the generic `catch` branch that would
//    otherwise surface a red `error` on the first hiccup. A reachable
//    backend that returns 5xx (or a bare adapter that throws a raw
//    network error) is almost always a momentary blip on a flaky mobile
//    link. Re-queue the failed snapshot and retry up to
//    `MAX_TRANSIENT_SAVE_RETRIES` times with growing backoff before
//    giving up and surfacing `error`.
//
// 2. Rate limits (HTTP 429) — the backend hands you a `retryAfterMs`.
//    Honour it, but floor it against the same backoff curve and escalate
//    per consecutive 429 so a server that returns a tiny (or zero)
//    cooldown can't pull you into a tight resend loop. There is
//    deliberately NO budget here: giving up on a rate limit would
//    surface a red error and stop autosave, which is worse than
//    continuing to wait — so the throttle path keeps retrying.

// How long to wait before a gentle background resume of a save that failed
// because the backend was unreachable (a raw network error / offline), as
// opposed to a transient 5xx from a reachable backend. An offline failure is
// handled apart from the fast escalating backoff above: with an offline mirror
// (`withLocalCache`) the bytes are already persisted, so it is never surfaced
// as a hard error and never spends the transient budget. Instead the save is
// retried on this single, slow, unbudgeted interval — enough that a flaky link
// recovers on its own, without the per-couple-of-seconds storm (and the heavy
// re-serialization each attempt drags in) the fast curve would create across a
// long outage. The `online` event, a connection probe, and the next edit also
// resume, so this interval only needs to be a gentle safety net.

// Equal jitter (rather than full jitter, `random(0, cap)`) guarantees
// each wait is at least half the cap so the curve always makes forward
// progress, while still de-correlating concurrent clients.

// `rand` is injectable so tests can pin the jitter; production passes
