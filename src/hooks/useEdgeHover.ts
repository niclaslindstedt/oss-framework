// Reveals a control that is otherwise invisible, by watching whether the

//
// A zero-footprint control is what this exists for: one that has to give its
// pixels back to the app when it isn't wanted, which means it can't be drawn
// *or* absorb clicks until the pointer actually goes looking for it (the
// sidebar's `SidebarCollapseRail` is the framework's own). Plain `:hover`
// can't express that — an element with `pointer-events: none` never hovers,
// and one with pointer events on steals every press aimed at whatever it
// covers. So the pointer is tracked at the window instead, and the caller
// flips both the paint and the pointer events on the answer.

 * True while a fine pointer sits inside `ref`'s box.
 *
 * @param ref     The element whose band is being watched. It must be laid out
 *                (an `opacity-0` overlay is fine; a `display: none` one is not,
 *                since a zero-sized box can never be entered).
 * @param enabled Off means "never hovering" — pass the hover-capability media
 *                query so a touch device, which can't hover at all, keeps the
 *                control permanently visible instead of permanently hidden.
 * @param slop    Pixels of grace added around the box *once entered*, so a
 *                cursor parked on the boundary can't flicker the control in
 *                and out on every sub-pixel jitter.
