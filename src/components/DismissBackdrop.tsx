// Invisible full-viewport backdrop that catches every tap outside the

// dropdown is open and should be treated as modal-from-the-rest-of-the-
// page. The host element (the dropdown panel) sits ABOVE the backdrop
// via its own higher z-index so taps on it still land where they should.
//
// Why a backdrop AND a document-level swallow:
//
// The backdrop alone catches the dismissing `pointerdown`, but the
// `onDismiss` callback (which closes the dropdown and unmounts THIS
// component) triggers a synchronous React render that tears the
// backdrop down before the rest of the tap sequence (`pointerup` /
// `mousedown` / `click`) arrives. Those trailing events then land on
// whatever element was underneath the tap — which on iOS is enough to
// focus the next control and pop the keyboard.
//
// `installTrailingSwallow` installs capture-phase listeners on
// `document` that survive the unmount: they run before React's root
// delegate sees the events, preventDefault the focus-shifting mouse
// events, and `stopImmediatePropagation` so React's onClick on the
// underlying button never fires. The listeners tear themselves down
// via a window-level `setTimeout` 300 ms later, so component unmount
// doesn't interrupt them.
